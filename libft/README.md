The first project at 42 Heilbronn is to build your own library.
I had to (re)create several functions.

I had to learn a lot for libft.

What is a Makefile, why is it used, what is it used for and how do you make one?
Basic things like string manipulation, pointer and pointer arithmetic.
Basics about memory, allocation, deallocation and have briefly learned about structs for the bonus.
